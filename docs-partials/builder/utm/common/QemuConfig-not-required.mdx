- `qemuargs` ([][]string) - Arbitrary QEMU arguments that are passed to the UTM virtual machine
  as QEMU additional arguments. Each element is a list of strings
  that are joined with a space to form a single QEMU argument.
  These arguments persist in the exported VM.
  
  Usage example:
  
  In JSON:
  ```json
  "qemuargs": [
    ["-accel", "hvf"],
    ["-cpu", "host"]
  ]
  ```
  
  In HCL2:
  ```hcl
  qemuargs = [
    ["-accel", "hvf"],
    ["-cpu", "host"],
  ]
  ```
